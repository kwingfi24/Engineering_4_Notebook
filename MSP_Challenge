#maybe use three main functions... 
#(1) A function that requests a guess from the user
#(2) A function that generates the hangman graphic and the blank letters
#       maybe the letters guessed, but it is optional 
#(3) A function that asks if the user wants to play again

#Function 1
print ("Player 1, what is the word?") 
a = input()
print ("\n" * 50) #clears the screen after player 1 has given the word
