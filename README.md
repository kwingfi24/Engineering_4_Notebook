## Python_Dice_Roller
### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that can automatically roll dice. The program also took user input to decide whether another dice should be rolled, or if the program should exit. The spicy version added complexity by asking the user to specify the number of sides on the dice and the number of dice to be rolled at a time. The user was then asked whether they wanted to roll again with the same settings, change the settings, or exit the program.

### Reflection
This assignment was relatively simple, but was challenging because I had not coded in Python for several months. I learned that I could import parts of toolboxes without importing the entire thing, but that changes the syntax of how I call the function later. I also learned about using a while loop to control whether a user wants to exit the program. For the spicy version, I needed to use nested loops. Python determines what is inside a loop by the indent level of each line of text, rather than brackets like some other coding styles. That means I need to be really careful with my tabs!

## Python_Calculator

### Assignment Description

This assignment takes the user's two inputs and does math with those two numbers. It gives the sum, difference, product, quotient and modulo.

This assignment was pretty simple, other than trying to find the code needed to find the modulo. The "f'" command embeds python expressions for formatting. The most difficult part was making the quotient only show 2 places after the decimal, but "round ( ,2)" worked for this.

## Quadratic_Solver
### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that can solve a quadratic using the variables/inputs given by the user. If the quadratic had no roots, the program gave the user the discriminant and said "No real roots". The user was then asked whether they wanted to run it again or exit the program.

I kept losing my progress on this assignment, so after 20 minutes or after big changes to the code have been made I save it. Using if statements made this assignment easier since there were two posssible outcomes, either the quadratic had rots or it didn't. Using the greater than or equal to, and less than symbols is simpiler than I first thought. I also used ra again to record the users input like in previous assignments. There are easier ways to simplify the math, I used some and didnt use others.

## Strings_and_loops
### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that will split the input given by the letter.

This was pretty simple to do, but there were new thing added. Both strings and loops were added, hence the name.......

## MSP_Challenge
### Assignment Description

Make a 2 player hangman game. This program will let player 2 play the game with  word given by player two. The spicy version also adds the missed letters. I've also included codes that will be more picky onthe plyer's guesses telling them if they already tried it, didn't enter a letter, or entered multiple letters.
